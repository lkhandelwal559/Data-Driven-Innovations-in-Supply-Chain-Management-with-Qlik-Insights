**DATA DRIVEN INNOVATIONSIN SUPPLY MANAGMENT SYSTEM WITH QLIK INSIGHTS**
The project aims to create a data-driven supply chain management system using Qlik, focusing on optimizing logistics, forecasting, and inventory management. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency and responsiveness by leveraging advanced analytics and data insights.
The project will provide an interactive overview and detailed view of the end-to-end supply chain, covering key performance indicators (KPIs), forecasting and planning, inventory management, multi-enterprise collaboration, and fulfillment and warehousing.
By harnessing the power of Qlik's data-driven insights, the project seeks to:
1. Facilitate holistic sales and operational planning
2. Optimize inventory levels to balance demand and cost efficiency
3. Synchronize business networks with supply chain analytics
4. Improve customer experience by streamlining fulfillment and efficiency

The project will utilize Qlik Sense, a modern platform for supply chain data analytics, to provide real-time visibility, AI-powered automation, and in-depth analysis of disparate data sources.
